# HookMastery: Unleashing the Power of Hooks

## Project Description

This project is a Next.js-based web application that enables users to generate AI-powered images from text prompts. It leverages the GPT-4 Image Generation API to create unique images based on user input. The app features a clean UI, state management, custom hooks, and robust API integration, following React best practices.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand and implement React state management using `useState`
- Create and utilize custom React hooks
- Work with environment variables for API key management
- Implement API routes in Next.js applications
- Develop reusable React components
- Manage application state across multiple components
- Implement responsive UI design with Tailwind CSS
- Handle asynchronous operations in React
- Follow React best practices for component structure and organization

---

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Next.js (v13 or later)
- React (v18 or later)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- GPT-4 API key (from RapidAPI)
- Modern web browser

## Best Practices Implemented

### Component Organization

- Logical separation of layout and functional components
- Reusable components (`ImageCard`)
- Proper component typing with TypeScript

### State Management

- Use of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Custom hook for API calls (`useFetchData`)
- Type-safe state definitions

### API Handling

- Server-side API route for secure API key usage
- Proper error handling and loading states

### Security

- API keys stored in environment variables
- Server-side API calls to protect keys
- Input sanitization

### UI/UX

- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Loading indicators
- Image gallery with preview functionality
- Clean, intuitive interface

### Type Safety

- TypeScript interfaces for all components and props
- Type-safe API responses
- Generic typing in custom hooks

---

## Key Features

### Image Generation

- Text prompt input
- API integration with GPT-4 Image Generation
- Loading states during generation

### Image Gallery

- History of generated images
- Thumbnail previews
- Click to view full image

### Responsive UI

- Works on mobile and desktop
- Clean, modern design
- Intuitive navigation

### Custom Hooks

- Reusable data fetching logic
- State management abstraction
- Error handling

## Development Notes

The project evolves through multiple versions (0x07 to 0x13), each adding new functionality:

- **0x07:** Basic setup and layout
- **0x08:** State management
- **0x09:** Environment configuration
- **0x10:** API integration
- **0x11:** Image tracking
- **0x12-0x13:** Custom hooks

The final version demonstrates:

- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable components and hooks
- Proper TypeScript implementation
- Good React patterns

**For production use, consider adding:**

- User authentication
- Persistent storage of generated images
- Advanced error handling
- Image editing capabilities
- Social sharing features
